# Data Analyst Portfolio by Tim Matthews Jr
This portfolio is a way to demonstrate my skills as a data analyst. Though I have been working professionally with data for a little over a year now, I have not had much to showcase my skills that I've procured through
my job and in my free time. 
## SQL Scripts and Projects. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### SQL Data Exploration with COVID Dataset
  In this project I performed exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server along with Microsoft Excel to initially format some of the data. In this project I highlight key insights
  regarding the lethality and spread of COVID and show vaccination rates in across the globe. Check it out<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL_DATA%20_EXPLORATION%202-3-2024.sql"> here.</a>



## Tableau Projects and Dashboards
------------------------------------------------------

### Visualizing COVID Data Exploration with Tableau Public
  In this dashboard I took my data exploration a few steps further and visualized it in Tableau showing important summary information regarding infection and mortality globally. 
  To check out my dashboard please follow the link <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timothy.matthews.jr/viz/CovidPortfolioProject_17088121208280/Dashboard1"> here</a>. 

### South Side of Chicago Foraging Project
  I did this project for fun and gathered the data from a site called FallingFruit.org. I've identified several sources of herbs, nuts, and fruits that can be foraged in Chicago's south side neighborhoods and leave the longitude and latitude for anyone looking to find each source of nutrients.

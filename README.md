# Data Analyst Portfolio by Tim Matthews Jr
This portfolio is a way to demonstrate my skills as a data analyst. Though I have been working professionally with data for a little over a year now, I have not had much to showcase the skills that I've procured through my job and in my free time. 

## Independent Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Exploratory COVID Data Analysis in SQL Server and Visualization in Tableau
 In this project I performed exploratory data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server along with Microsoft Excel to initially format some of the data. In this project I highlight key insights
  regarding the lethality and spread of COVID and show vaccination rates across the globe. Check it out<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL_DATA%20_EXPLORATION%202-3-2024.sql"> here</a>. I then took my data exploration a few steps further and visualized it in Tableau showing important summary information regarding infection and mortality globally.

## SQL Scripts. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SQL Server Data Cleaning with Nashville Housing Dataset
  The Nashville housing dataset is a classic example set of data to show off data cleaning skills in SQL. Here I was able to combine Excel with SQL Server to comb through the data, clean it, and format it so that
  it's ready for a detailed and insightful analysis. You can see how I did all this right<a href = "https://github.com/timguy1997/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/sql/Finished%20NashvilleHousing%20Data%20Cleaning%20Project%203-02-2024.sql"> here</a>.

### MYSQL Data Analysis of Contrived Hospital Dataset
   In this first SQL script I explore emergency room throughput, hospital demographics, and blood pressure data to draw insight about a fabricated hospital dataset. Having no access to pertinent and sensitive information, I believe being able to showcase my ability to gain insights is the next best thing. You can take a look at it<a href = "https://github.com/tmatthewsjr97/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/sql/Healthcare%20SQL%20Analysis%20I"> here</a>.

I then went on to explore cost of care and different aspects of hospital procedures in my next script. These were both a continuation of the same EDA, but I split them up to make them somewhat more presentable. You can look at part II <a href = "https://github.com/tmatthewsjr97/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/sql/Healthcare%20SQL%20Analysis%20II"> here</a>.


## Tableau Visualizations and Dashboards
------------------------------------------------------

### South Side of Chicago Foraging Project
  I did this project for fun and gathered the data from a site called FallingFruit.org. I've identified several sources of herbs, nuts, and fruits that can be foraged in Chicago's south side neighborhoods and leave the longitude and latitude for anyone looking to find each source of nutrients. The link to this project is available <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timothy.matthews.jr/viz/SouthSideChicagoForagingData/Accessibility"> here</a>. 

### Hospital Satisfaction Dashboard
  In this dashboard I show how satisfied patients were with over 3000 hospitals across the United States based on the standardized "Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems" (HCAHPS) survey. This survey is considered the first nationally standardized and publicly reported exploration on patient satisfaction. In this interactive dashboard you are able to filter by small(>100 beds), medium (100-500 beds), and large (>500 beds) hospitals to see how they stack against each other while also viewing the response rate and sample size of each hospital involved.
